# PyRap
Python powered neural network poet/poet/lyric writer.  In order to run this you must first add lyrics to songs you enjoy into the "raps" folder and then run the sync.bat file, and then ensure you have the dependencies installed.
# Dependencies
Pybrain was used for the neural network framework in this program.  You will need to have that installed to run this program.
# File Formatting
The program accepts normal txt files, however the formatting of the file name is important.  The name MUST be in the following format: "ArtistName::artname.txt".  Upload as many songs as you want!
# Calculating the artist
Once you have what you need in the rap folder, simply run the "sync.bat" file and after it finishes running run the pyrap.py file.  Once it finishes its calculations it will prompt you for a name and you can then enter in any name you desire and your artist will be saved to that file.
# Running the Example or precompiled rappers
In order to run the example type "python runrapper.py" into the command prompt.  Then type in EXAMPLE to run the example, an artist trained on a few poems.
